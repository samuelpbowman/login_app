This is a tutorial which I have completed in order to learn about authenticating
users on a RoR app. After trying to use Devise on rails-girls(which you will
also find on this account), I tried to learn Authlogic. I feel as though I have
had more success, as you will see if you take this repository out for a
spin. I will also be adding fun updates to this repository as I continue on my
adventures in RoR. Stay tuned!
